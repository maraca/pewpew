I guess this is a good example of why using bash often makes more sense than using python when you endup with lots of system calls in your python code :)

I started building a deploy script in python to ship code to a cluster of EC2 instances on AWS, and realized after a while that the whole procedure made much more sense in bash. 

This is how it works :

> ./deploy.sh /path/to/repo s3_bucket ~/.amazon/ec2-keypair.pem /path/to/file/to/execute/in/prod.sh 

It requires the ec2-api-tools to be installed.
